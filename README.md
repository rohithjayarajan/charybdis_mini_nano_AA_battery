# Charybdis Mini and Charybdis Nano with AA battery (14500 3.7v Li-Ion battery)

Charybdis is an ergonomic, open source keyboard designed and developed by [Bastardkb](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis).

The conventional wireless build for the Charybdis line of keyboards uses Li-Ion batteries, like the 401030 130mAh battery. The internal housing, which is specifically designed to be a wired keyboard, limits the battery size. Lower battery sizes offer less battery capacity, thereby reducing the battery life on the keyboard([ZMK battery life can be computed here](https://zmk.dev/power-profiler)).

My contribution towards this project is the addition of AA battery (14500 3.7v Li-Ion battery) holders to the Charybdis. This will increase the battery capacity usable for Charybdis to 2500-3800mAh from current values of 130-300mAh. This repository contains files for the right and left cases for the "Mini" and "Nano" versions of Charybdis. This builds on top of [Snap Fit Cases for Charybdis Mini and Charybdis Nano](https://github.com/rohithjayarajan/charybdis_mini_nano_snap_fit)
